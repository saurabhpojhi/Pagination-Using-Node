Server Side Pagination Using Node and Mongo


There are two ways you can implement pagination.

1. Client Side Pagination
2. Server Side Pagination

--- Server side pagination ----
There are two parameters involved in pagination.

1. Size – How many records per page
2. Page No – the number of the page

Suppose you have 1000 documents and you want 10 documents per page i.e size of the page is 10.

So a number of pages are 1000/10 = 10.

The page number can either begin with 0 or 1 depending on your choice.
